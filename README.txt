<Description of what you have accomplished>
##Mass Spring System
- Calculate the *Elastic* and *Damping* force.
- Calculate above two force generated by *Structural*, *Shear*,*Bend* spring.

##Force Field
- Interpolate forcefield value in 3D grid using [Trilinear interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilinear_interpolation).

##Collision Detection
- When a mass point is detected out of bounding box, a virtual spring will be generated between mass point and wall with the direction parellel to wall normal point from wall to mass point.
- Calculate *Penalty force*.

<Also, explain any extra credit that you have implemented.>
##Inclined Plane
- Detect the plane and mass point - plane collision the same way as wall collision.
- Render the plane using [plane-AABB intersection](http://www.asawicki.info/news_1428_finding_polygon_of_plane-aabb_intersection.html).

##Mouse Drag
- Click the left button and cells on surface will be detect. The program will choose the single top left point of the cell to be force center.
- The closer a mass point to force center, the greater force it will work with.
- The further you drag mouse from the click position, the larger force the system will experience.
- If the force is to large, spring system may run into some strange status...so be careful to drag the jello...
